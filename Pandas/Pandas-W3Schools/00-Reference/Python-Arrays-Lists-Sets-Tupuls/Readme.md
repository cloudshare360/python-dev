In Python, the data structures we've discussed are considered as follows:

Arrays: Arrays are considered as a sequence of elements, where each element is of the same data type.
Lists: Lists are also considered as a sequence of elements, where each element can be of any data type.
Tuples: Tuples are considered as an immutable sequence of elements, where each element can be of any data type.
Sets: Sets are considered as an unordered collection of unique elements, where each element is of any data type.
Dictionaries: Dictionaries are considered as an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and each value can be of any data type.

**Lists**

In Python, a list is defined using square brackets `[]` and elements are separated by commas `,`. Here's an example:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
You can also create a list with mixed data types:
```python
mixed_list = [1, 'hello', 3.14, True]
```
**Tuples**

A tuple is similar to a list, but it's defined using parentheses `()` instead of square brackets `[]`. Tuples are immutable, meaning you can't change their contents after creation. Here's an example:
```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```
You can also create a tuple with mixed data types:
```python
mixed_tuple = (1, 'hello', 3.14, True)
```
**Arrays**

Python has a built-in `array` module that allows you to create arrays. An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. Here's an example:
```python
import array
my_array = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```
The `'i'` argument specifies the data type of the array elements (in this case, integers).

**Sets**

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. In Python, a set is defined using the `set()` function or the `{}` syntax. Here's an example:
```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```
You can also create a set from a list or a string:
```python
my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
my_set = set('hello')
```
**Dictionary**

A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. In Python, a dictionary is defined using the `{}` syntax. Here's an example:
```python
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
```
Note that dictionaries are mutable, meaning you can add or remove key-value pairs after creation.

Here's a summary of the syntax for each data structure:

| Data Structure | Syntax |
| --- | --- |
| List | `[element1, element2, ...]` |
| Tuple | `(element1, element2, ...)` |
| Array | `array.array(typecode, [element1, element2, ...])` |
| Set | `set([element1, element2, ...])` or `{element1, element2, ...}` |
| Dictionary | `{key1: value1, key2: value2, ...}` |
